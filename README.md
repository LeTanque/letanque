Hello, I'm [leTanque](https://letanque.com/)!

I'm a software engineer who enjoys making music, taking things apart to understand how they work, and writing code that evokes positive emotions to my users. For a moment, if/when things are going well, making music, taking things apart, and writing code all become the same thing. 

Some things I remind myself of all the time:
- Smooth is slow, slow is fast.
- You can always save one week of planning by spending 3 weeks in additional development time.
- We write code for humans, not machines.
- The future you get is the future that you were a part of building; so take ownership and build it.

What I'm into lately:
- Hatch front end development.
- Learning from some of the most talented people I've ever met.
